# Importing into MDT

To install the Visual C++ Redistributables as a part of a reference image or for use with a deployment solution based on the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit, `Import-VcMdtApp` will import each of the Visual C++ Redistributables as a seperate application that includes silent command lines, platform support and the UninstallKey for detecting whether the Visual C++ Redistributable is already installed. Visual C++ Redistributables can be filtered for release and processor architecture.

```text
Get-VcList | Import-VcMdtApp -Path C:\Temp\VcRedist -MdtPath \\server\deployment
```

Each Redistributables will be imported into the deployment share with application properties for a successful deployment.

The folder structure in the deployment share, will look thus:

An option is provided to an Application Bundle with the `-Bundle` switch. This will import all of the Redistributables and create a single Application Bundle with the Redistributables as depedencies. If specified, the `-Bundle` switch will hide the Redistributables, leaving on the bundle visible in the Deployment Wizard.

Get-VcList | Import-VcMdtApp -Path C:\Temp\VcRedist -MdtPath \\server\deployment -Bundle
```
